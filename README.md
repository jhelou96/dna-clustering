# DNA clustering tool
An implementation of the agglomerative hierarchical algorithm used to cluster DNA sequences based on their similarity.

The software provides the user with an interface that allows him to add and delete manually DNA sequences stored inside a MySQL database.  DNA sequences can also be generated by specifying the number of sequences as well as the maximum number of nucleotides.

The user can then run the algorithms that clusters the DNA sequences present in the database based on their similarity and outputs a dendrogram containing the different clusters.
